# Sorting-Visualizer
Learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.
Thatâ€™s why I implemented this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work and through this project one can get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.

## Deployed at : https://sorting-visualiser-sv.netlify.app/

## High-Level Approach

  * Creating the website's User Interface (UI) using HTML, CSS and enhancing it further using Bootstrap; without actually implementing any of the app's core features.
  * Implementation of animations, effects and core functionalities (sorting algorithms) using JavaScript.
  * Publish to GitHub and host your project live.
